This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling. The `bug.js` file showcases the flawed code, attempting to parse a user ID without handling the case where the ID is not a number.  This can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.
